<h3>Quick Start</h3>
<ul>
<li>Go to a quiet room and put on a pair of headphones.</li>
<li>Launch What?</li>
<li>Press Space.</li>
<li>Press Right-Arrow if you heard a tone, Left-Arrow if not.</li>
<li>Repeat prior two steps until <i>All done</i> notice appears.
<li>Press <i>Save</i> to copy the audiogram to a file.
</ul>


<h3>Display</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Indicator Square</b> Green while a tone is playing</li>
<li><b>Gain</b> The gain (or amplitude) of the current tone in dB. </li>
<li><b>Pitch</b> The frequency (or pitch) of the current tone in Hz.</li>
<li><b>Step</b> Shows the progres through the series test frequencies. The position
    in the series is not affected by clicking in the graph.
</ul>

<h3>Keyboard</h3>

<ul>
<li><b>Space / Down-Arrow</b> <i>Play</i> the next tone of the test sequence.
Repeat the current tone on successive presses until the tone is accepted or rejected.</li>

<li><b>Up-Arrow</b> Repeat the current tone.</li>

<li><b>Left-Arrow</b> Reject the current tone. Increase the gain on the next <i>Play</i>,
advance to the next frequency when maximum gain reached. Rejected tones are marked with a red dot.</li>

<li><b>Right-Arrow</b> Accept the current tone. Advance to the next frequency at the lowest
gain on the next <i>Play</i>. Accepted tones are marked with a blue dot
and are saved for the audiogram. </li>

<li><b>Backspace</b> Backup through the sequence of test tones or tones as placed with a click,
whichever was the most recent.
Removes the marker from the graph.</li>
</ul>

<p>
You can change your mind between accept or reject any time before playing the next tone in the sequence
and you can repeat a tone any time before accept or reject.
You can change your mind after playing the next tone or tones in the sequence with Backspace.
You can also backup through the most recent series of tones placed with a mouse click with Backspace.
</p>

<h3>Mouse</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Click</b> in the graph to <i>Play</i> a tone at the indicated frequency and gain.
    Accept or reject the tone or continue in the test sequence using the keyboard as above.
    Use this to make adjustments in test-tone gains near the threshold of hearing for finer
    gain resolution than default 10 dB as used in the test-tone sequence.
    <p>
    Mouse clicks snap (are quantized) to the nearest 2 dB gain and .2 octave intervals, the same
    as the graph grid. With the default
    test parameters this is generally not the same as the points in the test sequence.
    </p>

</li>
</ul>

<h3>Controls</h3>
<ul>
    <li><b>Name</b> - Include <i>Name</i> in the title and filename of the audiogram.
    <li><b>Binaural, Left, Right</b> - Select the output channel for the test.</li>
    <li><b>Test Tone</b> - Play a brief 1000 Hz tone at 0 dB.</li>
    <li><b>Save</b> - Save the audiogram shown in the graph to an image file.</li>
    <li><b>Reset</b> - Clear the graph and reset the test-tone sequence to the beginning.</li>
    <li><b>Exit</b> - Exit What?</li>
</ul>

<h3>Menus</h3>

<ul>
    <li><b>File->Quit</b> Exit What?.
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><b>Parameters->Edit</b> Change the test parameters: start and end
    frequencies, number of frequency points per octave and number
    of gain points per 10 dB.
    The hearing loss range is 0 to 80 dB and is not settable.
    Changes to test parameters are saved between launches.</li>

    <li><b>Parameters->Show</b> Show the test parameters, frequencies, and gains
    of the test points.</li>

    <li><b>Parameters->Default</b> Set the test parameters: 125 -> 16,000 Hz, 1 gain point per 10 dB, and
    4 frequency points/octave.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><b>Help</b> - Self evident.</li>
</ul>


<h3>The Test Sequence</h3>
Tones are presented to the user in two independent ways, from a list of tones and gains,
or as placed with a mouse click in the test graph.  The list of tones and gains is known
as the <i>Test Sequence</i> and can be viewed using <i>Parameters->Show</i>.  The
frequencies in the <i>Test Sequence</i> are quantized to specific frequencies as
determined by the number of points per octave parameter.  The order of presentation is
randomized at each launch of <i>What?</i> and at each <i>Reset</i>.  The gains in the
<i>Test Sequence</i> are quantized to specific gains as determined by the number of points
per 10 dB parameter.  They are presented in order ofincreasing gain until accepted.

<p>
Tones from the <i>Test Sequence</i> and as placed by clicks are both reported in the
audiogram. They are independent except when backing up with Backspace. <i>What?</i>    
has separate history lists for the sequence and clicks and backs up through the
most recent list, either sequence list or click click.
