# Install What? on macOS

## System Requirements

What? was tested and packaged on an Mac mini M2 running macOS 15 Sequoia, a Mac with Apple silicon. It will not
work on an Intel-based Mac. I'll resolve that when I obtain an Intel-based Mac that can run Sequoia.

## Install What?
Open the downloaded .dmg file to launch a *Finder* window. Drag the What? icon to the *Applications* folder in
the *Finder* window.

## Run What?
Click on the What? icon in *Applications*.

macOS will block the execution of What? on initial launch because it is not signed and notarized.
To allow execution:

```
System Settings -> Privacy & Security -> Security -> Allow applications from
Select *What?*, Click *Open Anyway*
```

## Upgrade What?
Repeat the steps above in *Install What?*.

## Remove What?

Drag the What?icon in *Applications* to the *Trash*.
